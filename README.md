## Comments

The `flake.nix` and `flake.lock` should encompass all dependencies for this
project to work. It ensures I have complete reproducibility of the project. It
might present a steeper learning curve, but well worth it in my opinion.

System configuration is not in the scope for this flake, so things like
virtualization, permissions, editing tools and more are not handled here.

## Modules

- [Module 1: Intro to Docker and Terraform](./src/m1_module/README.md)
